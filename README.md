# personalDomain

This is my personal domain https://derek.meulmeester.ca built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies then run the development server:

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

Pushing to master will automatically deploy.
You can also deploy the directory manually by running [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```
