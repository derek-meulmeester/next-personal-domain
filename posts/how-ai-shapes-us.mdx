I've been working in tech since 2012, but something ocurred to me recently - I don't remember the details of my mindset at those earlier stages of
my career any longer. I know that I bought the domain `meulmeester.ca` around that time as a tool to learn. I didn't have any real
ideas on products to build but I wanted to get more familiar with deploying things on the internet. In the very beginning I used

the journey itself was important.

I'd like to try and capture my current state of mind, especially in the context of AI since it _seems_ like it's gearing up to be a
big shift in how we work, and potentially live. Though, I don't mean that in likely the same way that I see a lot of hype for AI 
conveying it. I think a good analogy to draw from is social media. Back in ~2008 when Facebook was really taking off there was a sense
that social media would be a tool to enable people to retain connections. It accomplished that goal in a lot of ways in that even as
someone who doesn't engage much, I still have the ability to
